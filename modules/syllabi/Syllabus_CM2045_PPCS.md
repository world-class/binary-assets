# Learning activities of this module
The module is comprised of the following elements: 
- **Lecture videos**. In each topic, you will find a sequence of videos. 
- **Readings**. Each topic may include several suggested readings. These are a core part of your learning, and, together with the videos, will cover all the concepts you need for this module. 
- **Practice assignments**. Each topic will include practice assignments, intended for you to assess your understanding of the topics. You will be allowed unlimited attempts at each practice quiz. There is no time limit on how long you take to complete each attempt at the quiz. These quizzes do not contribute toward your final score in the class. 
- **Discussion prompts**. Each topic includes discussion prompts. You will see the discussion prompt alongside other items in the lesson. Each prompt provides a space for you to respond. After responding, you can see and comment on your peers' responses. All prompts and responses are also accessible from the general discussion forum and the module discussion forum.
- **Peer review assignments**. Some topics include a practice peer review assignment. You will be asked to submit a piece of work and then review three of your peers’ submissions. You can attempt these assignments multiple times. The marks from these peer reviews do not count towards your overall grade.

## How to pass this module
The module will contain a range of summative and formative assessments. Summative assessments are assessments which contribute directly towards your final grade. Formative assessments do not count directly towards your final grade. Instead, they provide you with opportunities for low stakes practice and will often provide some sort of feedback about your progress. For example, a practice quiz might provide you with feedback about why a particular answer was wrong. 

The module has two assessments: a midterm coursework and an end-of-term exam, both worth 50%.

This is a detailed breakdown of all of the marks:

| Activity | Required? (Summative) | Deadline week | Estimated time per module | % of final grade |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Written, staff graded coursework | Yes | Approximately week 13 | 20 hours | 50% |
| Written examination | Yes | Approximately week 22 | 3-4 hours | 50% |
